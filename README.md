# Synchronize panning in multiple charts (SfCartesianChart) 

Flutter Cartesian Chart widget can be used to do synchronized panning in multiple charts using the callback events available in the chart and keys available in Flutter framework. Callback events are callback function or a method, which you pass as an argument into another function or method and can perform an action when you require it and a key is an identifier for widgets, elements, and semantics nodes. The callback used for the synchronized panning is the onZooming event available in the chart and the GlobalKey (subclass of Key class) is used as identifier.
